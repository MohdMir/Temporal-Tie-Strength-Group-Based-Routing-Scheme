# Temporal-Tie-Strength Group-Based Routing Scheme (TS-GBR)

This repository contains the code for the **TS-GBR** (Temporal-Tie-Strength Group-Based Routing Scheme) designed to improve the cost-effectiveness of message delivery 
in mobile opportunistic networks.

## Description

The TS-GBR scheme exploits several contact properties such as contact consistency, frequency, duration time, and contact aggregate to form k groups of nodes that
exhibit strong contact relationships. The temporal-tie strength metric is introduced to interpret intra- and inter-group contact patterns along with a time window. 
The scheme shows significant improvements in delivery rate and overhead when applied to SLAW, TVCM, and NCCU trace data.
